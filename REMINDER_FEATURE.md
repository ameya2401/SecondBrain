# Reminder Notification Feature

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The reminder notification feature helps users revisit websites they've saved but haven't checked in a while, preventing digital hoarding and ensuring valuable resources don't get forgotten.

## âš¡ How It Works

### Trigger Logic
- **3-Day Rule**: Reminders trigger for websites added 3+ days ago
- **7-Day Cooldown**: After a reminder is shown, it won't appear again for 7 days
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows one reminder at a time (oldest website first)

### User Actions
1. **Open Website**: Opens the website in a new tab and marks as "reminded"
2. **Check Later**: Dismisses the reminder for 7 days
3. **Dismiss (Ã—)**: Permanently disables reminders for that specific website

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New fields added to websites table
ALTER TABLE websites ADD COLUMN last_reminded_at timestamptz;
ALTER TABLE websites ADD COLUMN reminder_dismissed boolean DEFAULT false;
```

### Components Added
- `ReminderModal.tsx` - The popup reminder interface
- `useReminders.ts` - Hook managing reminder logic
- `update-reminder.js` - API endpoint for reminder updates

### Files Modified
- `types/index.ts` - Added reminder fields to Website interface
- `Dashboard.tsx` - Integrated reminder system
- `WebsiteDetailsModal.tsx` - Added reminder controls

## ðŸ”§ Key Fixes Applied

### Issue: Reminder Persisting After User Action
The original problem was that reminders kept appearing even after users clicked "Ã—" (dismiss) or "Check Later" because:

1. **Database updates weren't completing** before modal closed
2. **Local state wasn't refreshing** after database updates
3. **No error handling** for failed database operations
4. **Race conditions** between modal close and data updates

### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Synchronous Database Updates**: Made all reminder actions `async/await` to ensure completion
2. **Data Refresh Callback**: Added `triggerRefresh` to reload website data after reminder actions
3. **Visual Feedback**: Added loading states and spinners during processing
4. **Error Handling**: Added toast notifications for failed operations
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Modal still closes even if database update fails

## ðŸ§ª Testing Guide

### 1. Database Setup
Run the migration to add reminder fields:
```bash
# Apply the new migration
supabase db push
```

### 2. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario A: New Website (No Reminder)
1. Add a new website
2. Visit dashboard immediately
3. **Expected**: No reminder popup appears

#### Scenario B: Old Website (Reminder Due)
1. Manually update a website's `created_at` to 4 days ago:
```sql
UPDATE websites 
SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '4 days'
WHERE id = 'your-website-id';
```
2. Refresh dashboard
3. **Expected**: Reminder popup appears for that website

#### Scenario C: User Actions
Test each user action:

**Open Website:**
1. Click "Open Website" in reminder
2. **Expected**: Website opens in new tab, popup closes, `last_reminded_at` updated

**Check Later:**
1. Click "Check Later" in reminder  
2. **Expected**: Popup closes, `last_reminded_at` updated
3. **Expected**: Same reminder won't appear for 7 days

**Dismiss Forever:**
1. Click "Ã—" button in reminder
2. **Expected**: Popup closes, `reminder_dismissed` set to true
3. **Expected**: This website never triggers reminders again

#### Scenario D: Reminder Controls
1. Open any website details (click on a website card)
2. Scroll to reminder section
3. **Expected**: Shows current reminder status (Enabled/Disabled)
4. Click "Disable" or "Enable" button
5. **Expected**: Status toggles, database updated

#### Scenario E: Multiple Websites
1. Create 3 websites with `created_at` 3, 5, and 7 days ago
2. Refresh dashboard
3. **Expected**: Only shows reminder for oldest website (7 days ago)
4. Dismiss the reminder
5. **Expected**: Next refresh shows 5-day-old website

### 3. Edge Cases

#### Cooldown Period
1. Show reminder for a website
2. Click "Check Later"
3. Manually set `last_reminded_at` to 6 days ago
4. Refresh dashboard
5. **Expected**: No reminder (still in 7-day cooldown)

#### Dismissed Reminders
1. Dismiss reminders for a website
2. Manually reset `reminder_dismissed` to false in database
3. Refresh dashboard
4. **Expected**: Reminders work again for that website
